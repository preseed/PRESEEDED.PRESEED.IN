                            The origin of Step 3 happened for we wanted to create a platform
                            where we could share our own ideas and enable you to take up those ideas to co-create with
                            us,
                            for we can’t shape so many ideas alone. The ideas range from food we eat to technology we
                            use to
                            the government systems that run us. </p>

                            Our mission through Step 3 is to create entrepreneurs out of
                            even those who do not yet have an idea they were willing to back, let alone a b-plan or a
                            prototype. Even those who do not even have the technology or design skills. All they may
                            have is
                            a will to do something extraordinary someday. It may create more significant altruistic
                            entrepreneurs in the world than any other entrepreneurial initiative or culture has done in
                            the
                            past. </p>

                            So, it is being designed as a digital platform, made up of a community of
                            hackers, hustlers, designers and mentors who aid each other in ensuring the right idea is
                            thought. That right idea is the first step to success. </p>

                                    We believe that one of the most
                                    understated reasons, or largely a non-stated reason to fail is - to not start. Leave
                                    the matter of success and
                                    failure to perseverance; there is nothing more to success and failure. This is the

                            Ultimate goal of of our app Chattodo, until step 4 is to give its users
                            something so simple as if a ‘single white blank communication and notes making screen’,
                            which
                            will induce and enable the users to build upon their ideas into meaningful early-stage
                            startup,
                            regardless of users age, educational degrees, material resources or profession. And if the
                            user
                            fails in succeeding in taking their idea to the next level, they atleast have an education
                            degree that can make them employable. </p>

                                    I agree. I have a huge regard for Naval Ravikant and the Angelist team. So much
                                    regard that a lot of what I do at www.preseed.in is aimed at a partnership with
                                    AngelList to create the most extraordinary company of our times - AngelList. My
                                    conclusion has boiled down to the fact that I need to build my ios and android
                                    app as a communication tool for entrepreneurs on Angellist. So much that, it is
                                    Angelist I want to lauch my chatapp on. That as the first step for mychat app
                                    will steer it into the direction of a company that will while aiding Angellist,
                                    grow on to be bigger than Slack. <br><br>
                                    Dear Naval Ravikant, <br><br>
                                    I had bookmarked this article to read later, and as I finish reading it, I
                                    cannot help myself but reach out to you almost immediately on a matter I am
                                    deeply passionate about. Pardon my straightforwardness if you mind please.
                                    In the backdrop of this email, I want to tell you why I feel Angellist could
                                    help in disruption of the secondary education system, for men and women of
                                    ideas. And why I feel having a news feed system on AngelList just as a rip off
                                    of LinkedIn news feed system, not only indicates lack of novelty in AngeList
                                    feed system, but the lack of your team's understanding of the kind of feed
                                    system that will really truly aid entrepreneurs and their team. <br><br>
                                    I have paid so much attention to that kind of a design for news feed, that to my
                                    mind it looks like a separate product of communication and collaboration built
                                    exclusively for AngelList to start with, by AngelList. <br><br>
                                    Looking at the pace at which Angellist has grown towards direct online
                                    'collaboration' and information exchange for the entrepreneurial type, makes it
                                    very clear that Angellist has been into only profiling, a little bit into
                                    recruitment and a lot into investment facilitation in a uniquely democratic
                                    environment; while it is worth noting that they have one of the best chances to
                                    also be a tool for collaboration across the entire startup, its partners, it's
                                    customers all the way to productivity and management of productivity. They have
                                    done quite well in fixing the investment side of things, which really is the
                                    first step towards building the culture of ideas. The exact culture I am after
                                    riding upon my vision for a social network of action. I believe my tool will
                                    unleash the power of AngelList in ways unimaginable to most today. <br><br>
                                    I have covered some ground, not necessarily as per the black and white strategy
                                    of growth on metrics. My strategy for coding this product has always been to
                                    doing it with AngelList. So much that AngelList is at the heart of what I do. So
                                    I want to attempt making this product from within AngelList at a deal where, my
                                    social network of action will be an independent company and the opportunity to
                                    grow the social network of action beyond just AngelList remains in my hand.
                                    The ground I have covered leads me to a vision about the disruption of the
                                    education system as whole in the next 10 years. It will then just be a question
                                    of perspective. That, what does one think education means. In my plan, education
                                    upon collaboration is the way forward. <br><br>
                                    Education is best earned when building upon an idea and collaborating on it.
                                    Where it is earned from ones leaders' while working on a common goal.
                                    As per my strategy, our Social network of action will become the go to tool for
                                    young teams of startups to learn on topics they require to know, straight from
                                    their leaders, while building their startup forward, on it. And these teams and
                                    startups would have originally built connections on AngelList. These connections
                                    baking into relations and actions will happen all on our Social Network of
                                    action however. <br><br>

                            Nishchal spends half his day thinking about - so many decades of
                            internet, yet, the basic tenets of <b>democracy</b> remain the same, i.e. often, the false
                            narratives of our representatives are enough to keep them in power for 5 full years.
                            Nishchal
                            wants to<b> reinvent</b> how democracy is delivered to us and that too, through Chattodo. He
                            wants the elected representatives to list their todos, and the public to monitor those
                            todos,
                            and give feedback over chats with their representative’s offices. Promises spoken and
                            results
                            delivered must be visually represented on Chattodo’s dashboard for each country.

                                Can you imagine how complicated information about election is displayed in the form of
                                exit polls? Imagine if Real Time reality's deviations from political promises made by
                                politicians at the time of elections per politician who won, are displayed with that
                                kind of visual representation. It will hold the politicians acountable. We consider this
                                an important aspect for our vision for direct democracy.

                                I have a vague vision for a smart phone case/a voice recording device for
                                productivity<br>
                                too. Even a semi smart watch. Not a smart watch like apple watch. By that standard,
                                a<br>
                                less than a quarter smart watch. But that minimal watch which only serves the purpose
                                of<br>
                                Todeod without really being smart. May be a small ring with a voice recorder to have
                                you<br>
                                speak your mind into.<br>
                                <br> But all this is a figment of imagination, what is real is the current MVP, and how
                                that<br>
                                matures to serve best what it is already doing as of today. That is more important
                                than<br>
                                the figments of rest of my imagination about the most effective productivity eco
                                system.<br>
                                I repeat - I will be happy if Chattodo for now, just does one thing right - That is,
                                it<br>

                                    improve our very own lives,<br> at the least. That has made us see problems as
                                    opportunities, as gaps that need to get filled anyway. The fun part starts when
                                    after<br> tirelessly thinking, interacting, and researching about possible
                                    solutions (apps//products/platforms that already exist, trying to solve <br>the
                                    same or a similar problem), you get a crisp idea. That idea will take you into
                                    a journey suggested below. It’s that, what feeds our soul.</li>
                                                <li>Brainstorming —&nbsp;We discuss it with
                                    Preseed Web Lab team of thinkers, hustlers, designers, hackers and if need be
                                    our extended <br>network of some well achieved developers and entrepreneurs, for
                                    further validation, which kicks of the whole gammot of works<br> (It’s at this
                                    stage the idea goes into our PWL Idea Sheet on which we manage multiple ideas we
                                    are either toying with or looking to<br> toy with-:<br>
                                    <b>a. Further Research&nbsp;</b>— The most important aspect of today’s web
                                    development<br>
                                    1. Product Vision — At this stage a detailed research is done to ensure we are
                                    clearly differentiated from anything that already exists<br> within the scope of
                                    our vision. This stage greatly influences our products feature list. Anyway,
                                    generally since the goal is to build the <br>MVP first, we generally dabble with
                                    just one feature, that exact feature which solves the problem in question simply,
                                    no more, no less.<br>
                                    2. Communication of the product vision — We document the vision well enough to
                                    communicate with you, <br>the hackers/hustlers/designer, to have you understand
                                    what we are looking for.<br>
                                    3. Product Development Stage 1 - Researching and identifying elements of a
                                    complete product that already exist. Open APIs have <br>induced a culture of pre-built
                                    solutions for most of what we would look for, for development. Thus, leaving
                                    most of the developer’s<br> job today to research well in order to integrate all
                                    that exists and code only that, that doesn’t already exist. We try to ensure
                                    that it<br> is through the hacks we build our products for the point we are trying
                                    to make is that MVPs should not take a lot of resources to build.<br> (In fact,
                                    Preseed Web Lab is about building products like that, while teaching the same
                                    to many, or at least we hope so).</li>
                                
                                
                                    <li>
                                        3. b). Collaborative Whiteboarding (Done
                                        on mural.ly) and some sheets of papers for defining user experience — Here we
                                        together collaborate on anything that needs to be brought into our product plan
                                        perspective. The online collaborative nature of this stage<br> ensures that our
                                        team can collaborate on research from wherever they are located.<br>
                                        <b>c). Finally, packaging the concept</b>&nbsp;so far on a mural to state the
                                        product vision, R&amp;D data, UI/<b>user experience perspective<br></b>&nbsp;and
                                        product architecture broadly. (however, this step is optional at our end, for
                                        sometimes in words we define the product vision <br>and leave to the hackers to do
                                        the mockups based on their understanding of the product vision).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        4. MVP — This is where we need you, the
                                        hacker. The first iteration of the product is generally to build in the core
                                        functionality we need. <br>Then we run a feedback loop among ourselves to translate
                                        the first iteration to an MVP. This MVP is actually about the first use case<br> of
                                        the codes we are about to write. However, when that first use case is achieved
                                        to satisfaction with many users using it, we may or <br>may not move to tweaking
                                        the product to achieve other use cases too.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        5. Early adoption and lessons —
While the hacker is building the MVP, the PWL management bakes the possibility
of some early <br>adoption for the purpose of testing through feedbacks. This
system is about -<br>
a). Prelaunch Marketing<br>
b). Creating such a seem less experience of feedback that more can be taken.

                                       Step
1 — Our semi thought of ideas get listed on the internal spread sheet.
                                   </li>
                                    <li>
                                       Step
2 — All the corresponding details vis-vis the idea and its vision gets written
into this internal spread sheet, as the idea starts maturing.
                                   </li>
                                    <li>
                                       Step
3 — After the idea’s purpose is established with clarity over a period of time,
it gets listed openly on the web page of<br>&nbsp;<a
href="http://weblab.preseed.in/" target="_blank">Preseed Web Lab</a>&nbsp;in
those little boxes for all of you to take notice.
                                   </li>

4 — The prelaunch marketing and the parallel product vision documentation

                                    <li>
                                       Step
4a — The prelaunch marketing starts at this stage. To read about this further
read another post by me titled<br>&nbsp;<a
href="https://medium.com/preseed-web-lab/c68fd5dacc51" target="_blank">Marketing
precedes coding</a>.<br>
Step 4b — The product’s overall vision and, version v1 vision and features get
listed. The product version 1 vision is the vision<br> just about enough for the
MVP to be useful enough to early adopters.
                                   </li>
                                   <li>
                                       Step
5— We list opening for dev. at job boards like has geek or our own social media
campaigns.
                                   </li>
                                   <li>
                                       Step
6— People working on the idea get listed with their contact info once found
through job boards like has geek, geek list, <br>angel list etc. into the internal
sheet and into&nbsp;<a href="https://podio.com/" target="_blank">Podio</a>&nbsp;/
Productive work groups.
                                   </li>
                                   <li>
                                       Step
7— Thereafter, they remain in constant dialogues with us towards achieving the
MVP on our Product Vision
                                   </li>
                                   <li>
                                       Step
8 — MVPs get made; purely out of an idea, faith and remote collaboration.
                                   </li>
                                   <li>
                                       Step
9 — They are made marketable based on the protocols defined on our main guiding
sheet. We call this<br> ‘Product Packaging checklist’ sheet. This is the sheet
where we define the call to action for the product to<br> now evolve itself in the
market of early adopters.
                                   </li>
                                   <li>
                                       Step
10 — The MVPs are then hustled with to translate them into customer validated
products through our connections and<br> know how into MVP launches for getting
early adopters.
                                   </li>
                                    <li>
                                       Step
11 — Immediately after reasonable customer validation. The projects get listed
on as&nbsp;<a href="http://projects.preseed.in/" target="_blank">Preseed
Projects</a>.
                                   </li>
                                   <li>
                                       Step
12 — The projects are blown out of proportion here after, with more possible
use cases, if relevant.
                                   </li>
